# GitHub Setup Guide

## Push Your Project to GitHub

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to:** https://github.com
2. **Sign in** to your account
3. **Click "New repository"** (green button)
4. **Repository name:** `lucidgrowth-email-manager`
5. **Description:** `Comprehensive email management application with IMAP support, analytics, and search functionality`
6. **Make it Public** (so you can share the link)
7. **Don't initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Connect Local Project to GitHub

Run these commands in your project folder:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lucidgrowth-email-manager.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

### Step 3: Verify Upload

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Check that all files are there:**
   - backend/ folder
   - frontend/ folder
   - README.md
   - All other files

## Next Steps

After pushing to GitHub:

1. **Deploy backend to Railway** (using your GitHub repo)
2. **Deploy frontend to Netlify** (using your GitHub repo)
3. **Create demo video**
4. **Submit assignment**

## Your Repository URL

Your GitHub repository URL will be:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lucidgrowth-email-manager
```

**Save this URL - you'll need it for your assignment submission!**
